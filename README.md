# BootstrapChallengeJL
 A Bootstrap challenge for a Job interview

Please create a responsive html page based on the design files as the following specifications

-Implement Fira Sans as the base typo
-Adaptive page design is a minimum, for tablets please find your own design solution
-please implement a fluid page design
-If the user hovers over the button, it should become slightly bigger
-Add icons and list elements via glyph icons-webfont
-The Box on the right in the design should be hidden at start
-A click on the orange button shows the hidden text-box, the button should then be hidden
(Animation would be very nice but not necessary)

You are welcome to use libraries (e.g., SASS, bootstrap, due.js, angular).
If you do the task locally and upload your solution please add all the sources of any compiled files.
